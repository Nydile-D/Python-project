The Enhanced Bidirectional GAN-Based Technique for identifying intrusion in network through one-class classifier integration project aims to trackle the challenges of detecting new and unknown cyber threts in network intrusion detection system (IDS). Traditional IDS methods often fail to identify novel intrusion, highlighting the need for advanced techniques to improve detection. This project introduces an innovative approach by combining bidirectional generative adversarial network (BIGAN) with one-class classifier.
